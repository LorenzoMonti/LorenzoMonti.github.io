# About me

<p style="text-align: justify;"> I achieved my PhD in Computer Science and Engineering in March 2021 at the <a href="https://disi.unibo.it/" target="_blank">University of Bologna</a>. Main research activity comprehends the area of the Edge Computing and Edge Machine Learning in the Ubiquitous Computing context. In particular, I focused my attention on the Smart Building sector and how, through the technologies described above, it improves the comfort of the occupants.

During these years, I have also developed a great passion for non-standard interfaces, inparticular music, wearable and haptic ones. Currently, I'm working on different projects regarding Edge ML, mobile/wearable computing and context-aware computing.
