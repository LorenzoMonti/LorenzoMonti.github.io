# About me

<p style="text-align: justify;"> I achieved my Ph.D. in Computer Science and Engineering in March 2021 at the <a href="https://disi.unibo.it/" target="_blank">University of Bologna</a>. The main research activity comprehends the area of Edge Computing and Edge Machine Learning in the Ubiquitous Computing context. In particular, I focused my attention on the Smart Building sector and how, through the technologies described above, it improves the comfort of the occupants.

During these years, I have also developed a great passion for non-standard interfaces, especially music, wearable, and haptic ones. I'm currently a post-doc researcher at INAF, working on the control software for INAFs radio telescopes (Medicina, Noto and Sardinia Radio Telescope).

I volunteer for the association <a href="https://www.permessonegato.it/" target="_blank">Permesso Negato</a> against non-consensual pornography and for the association <a href="https://www.dnadellamusica.com/">DNA della musica</a> with which we "play" fragments of genome. Moreover, during my spare time I'm working on projects regarding Edge ML, mobile/wearable computing and context-aware computing.
