# About me

<p style="text-align: justify;"> Ph.D. student at <a href="https://disi.unibo.it/" target="_blank">University of Bologna</a>, attending the “Computer Science and Engineering” PhD course. Main research activity comprehends the area of the Human Computer Interaction in the Ubiquitous Computing context. In particular, I am interested in topics such as smart object interaction, mobile/wearable computing and context-aware computing. Currently, I am focusing on FMCW Radar sensors for gesture recognition.
