## Description
GlovePi is a low cost and open source assistive system exploiting a wearable device in order to support 
deaf-blind people in communication using the Malossi alphabet. More specifically, the system,
is composed by three main low cost components, such as: (i) a gardener glove; (ii) a Raspberry Pi; 
(iii) a MPR121 capacitive touch sensor module with expansion board. The MPR121 module 
works as bridge between the Raspberry Pi and the sensors in the glove, allowing the data transfer. 
Instead, the Raspberry Pi works as a hotspot wifi and as a server to transfer data to the client, 
an android application. In this way, the deaf-blind user can use the glove to deliver messages 
to other users, using the Malossi alphabet. The characters (and phrases) in this way created, 
will be sent to the android application and displayed or listen. Evaluation tests have been 
performed to measure the performance on the basis of false positive and false negative, obtaining 
interesting results in supporting to the feasibility of the here described approach.

## Malossi Alphabet
The Malossi alphabet gestures allowinginteraction  and  communication  are  presses  and  pinches at different points 
of the fingers and on the top of the palm. This  last  alphabet  was  invented  by  Eugenio  Malossi,  an Italian  
deaf-blind  teacher.  The  Malossi  alphabet  is  considered extremely intuitive, and it relies on basic touch cues. 
In particular, letters are located in a clockwise order, over the phalanxes, as  shown  in  Figure.  
Letters  from  A  to  O  arepressed,  and  letters  from  P  to  Z  are  pinched.  Thanks  to  its simplicity, 
this alphabet is widely employed with children and people having cognitive impairments, who cannot learn more complex  
communication  methods  (e.g.,  the  Lorm  or  Braille alphabets).

## The Prototype
The system architecture is composed by three main components as shown in Figure: (i) a gardener glove, without any sewings between the 
fingersand the handbreadth has been purchased; (ii) a Raspberry Pi; (iii)a MPR121 capacitive touch sensor module with 
expansion board. Moreover, an Android app has been developed to communicate with the server (Raspberry Pi) and display
and listen the phases created by the deaf-blind user, using the glove, during the typing of the Malossi alphabet.
